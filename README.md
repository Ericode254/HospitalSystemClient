# Installation and running of application
-  To make sure that all the dependencies that the application needs are met run:
`npm i` or `npm install` while still in the directory where the project files are.
-  Run `npm run dev` so as to run the whole project

# Set up before running the application
-  Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and use the env.txt file as a boiler plate to fill in the required fields. For this, create an account in emailjs and copy the fields as desired.
